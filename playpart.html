        _[looking at her watch]_. Not yet—and the time is nearly up. If only he
        does not—. _[Listens again.]_ Ah, there he is. _[Goes into the hall and
        opens the outer door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the
        stairs. She whispers.]_ Come in. There is no one here.
        <p><br/>
            MRS LINDE.
        It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my
        rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers
        are at the dance upstairs. </p><p> KROGSTAD.<br/>
_[coming into the room]_. Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?</p><p>   MRS LINDE.<br/>Yes, why not? </p>
    <p>  KROGSTAD.<br/>Certainly—why not?</p>
    <p> MRS LINDE.<br/>Now, Nils, let us have a talk.</p>
    <p>KROGSTAD.<br/>
Can we two have anything to talk about?</p>
